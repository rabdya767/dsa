Data Structures : 
    Data Structures are different way of organizing data on your computer, that can be used effectively.

Algorithm : 
    Set of instructions to complete a task.
    Set of rules for a computer program to accomplish a task.

Good Algorithm : 
    - Correctness
    - Efficiency

Types of Data Structures : 
    - Primitive
        - Integer
        - Float
        - Character
        - Boolean
    - Non Primitive
        - Linear
            - Static
                -Array
            - Dynamic
                - Linked List
                - Stack
                - Queue
        - Non linear
            - Tree
            - Graph

Types of Algorithms : 
    - Simple Recursive Algorithms
    - Divide and Conquer Algorithms
